# Portfolio

This repository showcases the projects that demonstrate my skills as a full-stack developer. Below is an overview of the technologies I commonly use.
Both the Front-End and the Back-End are written in Javascript.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **ReactJS** - A library for building interfaces.
- **Typescript** - Superset of Javascript for static typing.
- **Apollo Client** - A graphql client to interact with APIs.
- **Styled Components** - A library for designing reusable components.
- **Zod** - A library for creating schemas for validating inputs.

### Backend
- **Node.js** - A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Koa** – A lightweight web framework.
- **GraphQL** – A query language for APIs that enables fetching data.
- **Apollo Server (Koa)** – Integrates GraphQL into the Koa framework.
- **PostgreSQL** – A relational database for storing structured data.
- **Redis** – An in-memory data structure store used for caching.

### Additional Skills & Technologies
These technologies are part of my skill set and have been used in other contexts such as work projects, though not currently featured in this portfolio:
- **HTML / CSS** – Solid understanding of semantic structure and responsive design.
- **SCSS / SASS** – Experience with modular CSS architecture and nesting.
- **REST APIs** – Experience designing and implementing endpoints in production environments.
- **Next.js** – Server-side rendering and static site generation with React.
- **Express.js** – A minimalist web framework for building REST APIs.

## Projects

- Book catalog – A library system to manage libraries, books, authors, and users.

Each project folder contains a specific 'README.md' with the tech stack used in that project.
